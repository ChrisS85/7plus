# ShowMenu #
This action shows a menu. Before a menu can be shown, menu items need to be added to it by creating events with [MenuItem](docsTriggersMenuItem.md) triggers. A menu is referred to by the "Menu" property, which can be set in MenuItem triggers and in ShowMenu actions.
It's also possible to specify the x and y position of the menu.
