7plus Version 2.2.0 changelog

New Functions:
+ Unicode support
+ 64 bit support
+ Copy Events, Action and Condition
+ Added hotstrings, which can be used to expand abbreviations (e.g. "btw" -> "by the way")
+ Program Launcher Accessor plugin now expands placeholders so you can use placeholders like %ProgramFiles%
+ Added dropping files on Accessor keywords list
+ Added PageUp/Down to Accessor list
+ Added support for Hotkey release events (UP in Hotkey GUI)
+ Added support for auto-updating event configuration so users can receive bugfixes and new events between version updates.
  As a consequence of this, 7plus now uses a versioning scheme consisting of 4 numbers, where the last one represents the
  number of applied patches since the last release.
  
Bugfixes:
- Fixed CTRL+P accidently being assigned
- Fixed a scrolling bug in Accessor
- Fixed Alt+LButton: Move windows option not appearing in settings
- Fixed a bug pausing the script when Notepad++ wasn't running/installed
- Fixed capital C and X not working in Explorer address and search bar
