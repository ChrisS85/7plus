# FocusControl #
This action sets the keyboard focus to a specific control. It is used mainly for controlling other programs by [sending keyboard input](docsActionsSendKeys.md) to them.

You can use the [WindowFilter controls](docsGenericWindowFilter.md) to select the window on which the focus should be changed, this is the active window in most cases.
Additionally you need to enter the [ClassNN](docsGenericClassNN.md), the text of the control, or the window handle of the control you want to focus.
