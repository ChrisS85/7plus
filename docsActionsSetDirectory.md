# SetDirectory #
This action changes the directory of an explorer window. You can use the[window filter](docsActionsWindowFilter.md) controls to select the explorer window. The path is specified in Path, either by directly entering a fixed path or [placeholder](docsGenericPlaceholders.md), or by entering "backward","forward" or "upward" to navigate in that direction.

# Usage examples #
This can be used to create hotkeys that navigate explorer to specific directories. It is similar to [FastFoldersRecall](docsActionsFastFoldersRecall.md), but it works with any folder and isn't limited to slots.

In 7plus this action is used to go upwards when a double click on empty space in explorer file list is detected.
