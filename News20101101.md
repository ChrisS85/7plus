# 7plus Version 2.1.0 released! #

The next version of 7plus is here. It improves the event system by a few things such as categories for the events, making it much smoother to handle.

The biggest change, however, is the new [Accessor](docsAccessor.md) tool. Think of it as a launcher similar to programs like Launchy or Exekutor, but with many very useful plugins already integrated.
It can run programs, switch windows, uninstall programs, do all kinds of web searches, browse the file system, do calculations and unit conversions, show weather forecast, take notes and much more!

FTP connection data is now stored in profiles instead of storing it in the single events, so it isn't necessary anymore to enter the same data multiple times.

2.1.0 introduces the possibility to run 7plus in portable mode (command line: "-portable") and use it without admin privileges (see settings->misc).
This means it is now possible to run it on limited user accounts and from USB sticks.
Of course some features will have to be sacrificed in these modes.

There are also lots of bug fixes since the last version, and everything should be a bit smoother I hope.

Users who don't use autoupdate or haven't used 7plus before can get the newest version [here](http://code.google.com/p/7plus/downloads/list).
