# MouseOver #
This condition is used to check if the mouse is over a specific window, or over a part of a window, such as over a titlebar. To check for the part of a window, select it in "Mouse Over" property, or select "Window" there to use [window filter](docsGenericWindowFilter.md) controls to limit it to specific windows. Using "UnderMouse" option is obviously redundant here.

7plus uses this condition to execute various actions when you right- or middle-click on titlebar, minimize and close button.
