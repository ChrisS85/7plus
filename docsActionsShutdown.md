# Shutdown #
This action can make the PC shutdown, reboot, logoff, hibernate or go into standby.
You may also select if you want windows to force-close all applications if they don't react.

# Usage examples #
  * You might want to put this on a [hotkey](docsTriggersHotkey.md) if your keyboard has no such key, or you want to reassign it.
  * Another possibility is combining it with a [timer trigger](docsTriggersTimer.md), to shutdown the PC after a certain time.
