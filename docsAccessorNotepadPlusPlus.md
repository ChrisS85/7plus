# Notepad++ Tab Switcher Accessor Plugin #
The Notepad++ tab switcher accessor plugin allows to activate Notepad++ and show a specific tab when Notepad++ is running.

This is very useful for users that use Notepad++ for writing code and have many tabs open.

This plugin will remember the string that was previously typed when the current tab was open and restore it when accessor opens while Notepad++ is active. Additionally to this, the priority of the results of this plugin are increased when Notepad++ was active when Accessor was opened, so they will be shown at the top of the list.

The context menu of this plugin allows to:
  * Open a file with its assigned program
  * Open the path of a file in Explorer/CMD
  * Copy the path of the file to clipboard
  * Show the explorer context menu of the file
