# Screenshot #
This action takes a screenshot of the active window or the screen, and saves it to a file.
You may also set the desired image quality.

# Usage examples #
  * In 7plus this is used to take screenshots and directly upload them to an FTP server, so you can easily share them with others.
  * You can also use it locally if you leave out the FTP upload function and save it to a desired folder. You may want to use [input action](docsActionsInput.md) or ${DateTime} [placeholder](docsGenericPlaceholders.md) to give it a unique name.
  * Another possible combination is usage with a [timer trigger](docsTriggersTimer.md), to track what happens on a computer.
