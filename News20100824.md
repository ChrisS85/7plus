# 7plus Version 2.0.0 released! #
After a long wait the next version is finally here, with coming with an increase in the major version number. This huge step was made because the internal structure was completely changed into an event-based system. This system allows to customize nearly every feature of 7plus, including hotkeys. Apart from that, it also makes creating custom features possible.

There are a few things that need to be set up before it is fully usable:

  * For FTP functions, the FTP account data will have to be entered into each event. I'm planning to add profiles for FTP features, but they didn't make it into this version yet.
  * Text and image editors will have to be customized. By default they are set to use Paint.NET and Notepad++, but users will most likely change them to something else.

Every trigger, condition and action type in the new event system is documented in the wiki on this page. The specific pages are accessible from inside the program by clicking the help button next to the selected item.

Users who don't use autoupdate or haven't used 7plus before can get the newest version [here](http://code.google.com/p/7plus/downloads/list).
