= 7plus Version 2.2.0 released! =

This version finally adds Unicode and 64bit support. If you are using the source version, you need to switch to Autohotkey_L Unicode version and use the 64bit version if you are on a 64bit system.

This version adds hotstrings, which allow to expand abbreviations such as "btw" to "by the way".

The event system also gets some improvements; It is now possible to copy and paste events/actions and conditions. Additionally there are now descriptions for each event.

The update process from one version to the next version is also improved, 7plus will now try to merge new events and fixes on the old events with the previous version of Events.xml when using the AutoUpdate function. This means that you get to keep all custom hotkeys and you will still get all changes from the new version. It's also possible now for me to release patches for the Events.xml file between releases to fix minor bugs in it.

There are also some smaller new features and many bug fixes, for a full list of changes please see [Changelog2dot2dot0 here].

You can get the appropriate release in the [http://code.google.com/p/7plus/downloads/list Downloads section].

As always, please feel free to report any bugs, suggestions or feature requests.
