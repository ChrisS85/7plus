=Description=
Written in Autohotkey, 7plus is a project which tries to make working with Windows much more comfortable by adding features to explorer, window handling, and lots of other small tweaks.
For example it allows you to quickly upload files to an FTP server directly from explorer with a single hotkey, navigate to your favorite folders with numpad keys, keep windows always on top, etc...

==To everyone who notices that something else doesn't work when 7plus runs: Make sure there is no interference with other programs, such as keyboard or mouse drivers, or other tweaking utitlities!==

=Features=
As of version 2.0.0, 7plus allows nearly all features to be fully customized. You can change the hotkeys and other parameters defining a feature and you can also *create your own features!*
7plus now uses an events system, that is based on triggers, conditions and actions. When a trigger (e.g. a hotkey) is activated, 7plus checks if the associated conditions (such as a specific window being active) are fulfilled, and if they are, it runs a series of actions (like sending keys, selecting files, etc..). Nearly all previous features of 7plus are now implemented using this system!

Here are some of the most important features:

  * Store *favorite folders* and recall them for very fast navigation [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTIGxue6WCY (Video 1)] [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC6cnG87j2M (Video 2)]
