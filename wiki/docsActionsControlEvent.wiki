= ControlEvent =

This action is used to control other events. It is possible to trigger other events, and to enable/disable them. You can also toggle between enabled and disabled state.
The ControlEvent also has the possibility to be executed only when a condition is fulfilled. For the meanings of those parameters, refer to the [docsConditionsIf If] condition. This is also demonstrated in the dynamic timer feature.

= Tips =

If an event is supposed to only get triggered through such a trigger action, it is best practice to use a [docsTriggersNone None] trigger, so it does not get triggered under other circumstances.
