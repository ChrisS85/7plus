= File System Browser Plugin=

The file system browser plugin allows to enter paths and browse folders in Accessor.

Pressing Enter will either launch the selected file or dive into the selected folder.
When there is more than one result, TAB will toggle through the results. If there is only one result, TAB will act like the Enter key and go into the folder.

To show only file types of a certain kind, you may enter `*`.extensions at the end of the string, e.g. "C:\Downloads\`*`.zip" to only show zip files in the directory.

Opening a file by this method will append it to the [docsAccessorProgramLauncher Program launcher plugin's] cache, so it can be accessed next time by simply typing a part of its filename.

In addition, this plugin allows to:
  * Open the path of a folder/file in explorer or CMD or copying it to the clipboard
  * Running a program with arguments
  * Showing the explorer context menu of the selected item.

This plugin has some advanced configuration settings. It's possible to add cache paths in which it will look for files with proper extensions (usually exe and lnk). For each cache path its possible to define custom actions which appear in the context menu. An example for this might be a cache path for music files, where the default action would play the file. A custom action can be defined to enqueue the file to the current playlist (if the player has an appropriate command line option).
