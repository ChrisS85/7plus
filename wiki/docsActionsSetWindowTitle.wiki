= SetWindowTitle =
This action sets the title of a window. Use the [docsGenericWindowFilter window filter] controls to select a window, and enter the new title as title parameter.

You can use ${Title} to access the title of the active window. This can be used to append something to the title, such as the current time.

Some programs might behave erratic when using this function, as they just add something to the current title themselves, so the texts can stack up.
