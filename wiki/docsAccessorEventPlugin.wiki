= Event Plugin =
This plugin is used in combination with the [docsTriggersAccessorTrigger Accessor Trigger]. It searches through all events that use the Accessor Trigger and shows matching ones in Accessor where they can be executed.

It is possible to trigger events with Accessor this way. 7plus comes with some preconfigured events for this. They are used to shutdown/reboot/hibernate/... the PC or show a message.

It's useful to combine these events with the timed execution feature of Accessor like this:
 * "Shutdown in 1 hour, 5 minutes"
 * "Message Pizza in 10mins"
