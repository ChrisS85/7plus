Accessor:
 * Accessor has been rewritten from scratch and is now much more modular and powerful. All of its plugins were also rewritten and improved. There are also some new ones. Here's an excerpt of the most important new things:
  * Accessor now makes use of the text that is selected before the Accessor window is opened. Among other things it's now possible to select a file path, URL or registry key, open Accessor and it will be inserted as command automatically. The selection is also used in other plugins where appropriate.
  * It is now possible to use a timer in combination with Accessor commands. Examples:
   * Message Pizza in 10 min
   * Shutdown in 1hour 30 minutes
  * New registry plugin to quickly open Regedit at a key. Useful for going to keys which are written on webpages.
  * New Accessor history plugin that keeps track of the recently executed Accessor commands. This history is now visible when Accessor is opened in no specific context.
  * New Recent Folders plugin that keeps track of recently used folders. It can be used to quickly switch folders in Explorer, file dialogs, CMD and WinRar. Very useful!
  * New Keyword plugin to quickly create keywords by selecting text or a file, open Accessor and type "Learn as [Keyword]". Credits go out to Enso Launcher for the idea!
  * The URL plugin can now read and access bookmarks of Opera, Chrome and IE.
  * New commands: Shutdown, Reboot, Hibernate, Standby, LogOff, Lock, Message
  * Various hotkeys and additional actions have been added for the plugins. As an example, results that are folders can now be opened directly in the file system plugin by pressing CTRL + F while the result is selected.
  * Some new settings to control the behavior and appearance, including support for Aero window style.
