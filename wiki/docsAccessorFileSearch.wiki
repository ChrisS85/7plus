= File Search Plugin =
This plugin is used to search the File System in Accessor. You may have noticed a notification from 7plus about File system indexing. 7plus builds an index of the file system for quick searching. Depending on the search text, the number of files on your disks and some other factors a search takes about 0-20 seconds.

To start a search, simply type "find [Text to be found]". If you want to limit the search to a specific directory, you can add the directory like this: 
 * "find cmd in C:\Windows"
You can quickly search in a directory by selecting a directory in Acecssor and pressing *CTRL + F*.
