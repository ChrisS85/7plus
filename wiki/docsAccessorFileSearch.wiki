= File Search Plugin =
This plugin is used to search the File System in Accessor. You may have noticed a notification from 7plus about File system indexing. 7plus builds an index of the file system for quick searching. Depending on the search text, the number of files on your disks and some other factors a search takes about 0-20 seconds. For short search strings you will have to press enter once to start the search. Those searches usually take longer than more refined ones.

To start a search, simply type "find `[Text to be found`]". If you want to limit the search to a specific directory, you can add the directory like this: 
 * "find cmd.exe in C:\Windows"
You can quickly search in a directory by selecting a directory in Acecssor and pressing *CTRL + F*.

The file system index can take up to 10-30 MB RAM, depending on the number of files on your disks. This is usually not an issue with todays hardware unless you are often short on free RAM.
