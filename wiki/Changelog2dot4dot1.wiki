= 7plus Version 2.4.1 Changelog =

New Functions:
 * Added key mappings for scientific calculators. Characters such as brackets can now be written with Numpad keys when NumLock is off.
 * Added a function that allows running temporary AutoHotkey scripts (WIN + T). It requires that an AutoHotkey interpreter is installed and the .ahk extension is assigned to it.
 * Added a button on the FTP profiles page to test the connection.
 * Added a SendMail action for sending mails using SMTP.
 * WIN + G: Run a Google search for the selected text.
 * Added ${SelText} placeholder for the currently selected text.
 * Run action can now use the same level of elevation as 7plus. This can be useful to execute more special commands, for example verbs like *Edit.
