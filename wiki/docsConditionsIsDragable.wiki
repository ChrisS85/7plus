= IsDragable =

This condition checks if a window may be dragged by the [docsActionsMouseWindowDrag MouseWindowDrag] and [docsActionsMouseWindowResize MouseWindowResize] actions. It automatically excludes Notepad++ and Scite because they have a ALT+Left drag column selection and this key is typically used with those actions.
