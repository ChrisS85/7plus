= MouseOver =
This condition is used to check if the mouse is over a specific window, or over a part of a window, such as over a titlebar. To check for the part of a window, select it in "Mouse Over" property, or select "Window" there to use [docsGenericWindowFilter window filter] controls to limit it to specific windows. Using "UnderMouse" option is obviously redundant here.
