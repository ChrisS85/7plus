= 7plus Version 2.4.0 Changelog =

New Functions:
 * Added search and replace dialog for file names and file contents
 * Added directory context menu item for flat view
 * Added URL shortener (WIN+S with URL in clipboard)
 * Added a settings page with generic windows settings (No bloat, only important ones!)
 * Added KeyDelay setting for SendKeys action
 * Added ShowEvents option (available only through manual editing of Settings.ini in [General] category) to show execution order of events
 * Added DoubleClick option to MosueClick action
 * Added ClipPaste action to paste a specific entry from the clipboard manager list without showing the menu (Useful when active window must not be changed, i.e. explorer renaming)
 * Added the ability to create new files of any type by selecting a base file in the New File action that is copied to the target destination
 * Added screen corner triggers and made AeroFlip3D an event rather than a setting
 * Added a new hotkey event (CTRL+M) to merge all explorer windows into a single one with tabs

Bugfixes:
 * Fixed missing \ when copying paths of network shares
 * Fixed not being able to navigate to network drives
 * Reimplemented middle mouse button features in event system to avoid some problems with this button. As a result of this, a few additional conditions were added.
 * Fixed Alt window drag not being able to drag a window to the outer left side of the screen
 * Fixed some access right modifications for registry keys required for explorer buttons. If they didn't show up before they should do so now. It may be necessary to disable/enable the FastFolder setting to make them show up.
Changes:
 * Huge code rewrite for some key portions related to explorer. As a result, status bar enhancements and explorer tabs are now visible on all explorer windows at once.
 * Complete rewrite of Slide Windows feature. It should be much better now, with more options, multi-monitor support, support for child windows and no windows getting lost anymore.
 * Redesign of the "Edit Event" and "Edit Subevent" window. There is now only one window in which everything can be edited.
 * Moved Hotkey editing into the Trigger configuration GUI so it can be edited in the same window. Also it will now show the previously selected trigger.
