= Timer =

This trigger gets triggered after a certain time. It is possible to use a visible trigger, in which case 7plus displays a small window with the time that is left, and some buttons to start/pause/reset/stop the timer.
You can also make it automatically restart itself when the time ran out.

If the timer is visible, it will display the name of its event unless you specify a custom name in the timer properties.

= Tips =

  * It is possible to control a timer with a [docsActionsControlTimer ControlTimer] action.
  * You can easily add a new timer by right clicking the 7plus tray icon and selecting "Add timer".
