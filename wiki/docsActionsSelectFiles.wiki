= SelectFiles =
This action selects files matching a filter in explorer. The *Filter* is a comma-separated list of entries. You may also use wildcards, e.g. "`*`.jpg,`*`.png" to select all jpg and png files.
There are a few properties:
|| *Parameter* || *Description* ||
|| Clear selection first || If not selected, the matching items will be appended to the current selection.||
|| Deselect files || If selected, matching files will be removed from current selection instead of being selected.||
||Automatically add wildcards to start and end||If selected, a file will also match if the filter contains only a substring of its name without wildcards. It basically transforms filter to `*`filter`*`.||

You can use [docsGenericWindowFilter window filter] controls to specify the explorer window, but usually you'll want to leave it at "Active".

= Usage examples =
  * 7plus uses this in combination with the [docsActionsInput input] action, to let the user enter a filter by which files are selected.
