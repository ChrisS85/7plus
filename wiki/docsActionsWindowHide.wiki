= WindowHide =
This action hides a window. It will still be running, but not visible to the user. This is useful for windows you don't want to see, such as update confirmations asking you to reboot.
Use the [docsGenericWindowFilter WindowFilter controls] to select the window.
To later unhide a window again, use [docsActionsWindowShow WindowShow].
