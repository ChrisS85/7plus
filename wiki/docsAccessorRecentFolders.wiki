= Recent Folders Plugin =
This plugin is used to access often used directories through Accessor. It keeps track of the folder history of Explorer and other programs and stores frequently used ones. These can simply be used in Accessor by typing a part of their name.

This plugin is very useful to navigate to a directory in Explorer windows and file dialogs. It can also open a new Explorer window if no navigable window is currently active.

In navigable windows this plugin will show the directory history directly upon opening Accessor so you can navigate to a folder without typing.
