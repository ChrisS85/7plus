= Event System overview =
Since 2.0.0, 7plus features a new system wich adds lots of customizability and even lets you create own functions! The basic concept is that you define a trigger, which gets activated under certain circumstances, then you may add some additional conditions that decide if the trigger should really be activated, and then you can add a list of actions to be carried out. The system is quite versatile, and there are many useful combinations.
