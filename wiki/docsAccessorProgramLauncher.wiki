= Program Launcher Accessor Plugin =

This plugin allows to run programs by typing a part of the program's name.

The plugin uses a cache in which the paths to the programs are stored. By default, only the .lnk files in the start menu are included, but it is also possible to add custom include paths in the settings.

For speed and clarity reasons, it is not suggested to include large folders like the Program Files or Windows directory. Instead, this plugin maintains a dynamic cache in which it stores programs which have been running during the program's runtime. This way you can run a program once and this plugin will know about it in the future.
Another way to add a program to this cache is by running it through the [docsAccessorFileSystem file system accessor plugin].

Like the [docsAccessorFileSystem file system accessor plugin], you can:
  * Open a program with arguments
  * Open its executable path in explorer or CMD
  * Copy its executable path to the clipboard
  * Show the context menu of the executable file
