= Placeholders =
Placeholders are an important concept in the event system, as they allow you to dynamically set parameters of conditions and actions. Placeholders are formatted like this: ${Placeholder}
You can use placeholders everywhere you see a placeholder button.
Below is a list of placeholders in 7plus. Some actions also define custom placeholders, take a look in the documentation of the action to see it. In most cases they are also directly mentioned in the configuration dialog.
