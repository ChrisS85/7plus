= 7plus Version 2.3.0 released! =

The next version is released! Unfortunately there were some issues with the updater, but all should be fine now. If anyone already downloaded the latest version, I suggest a reinstall to avoid future problems with the autoupdate function.

Nevertheless, this release fixes a lot of bugs. 2.2.0 was buggy in some aspects, especially on x64 systems, so much work has been put into making everything as bug free as possible.

There are also many new features. Here are some of the most important ones:
  * Context menu support for 7plus events. There are also some tools added to the context menu by default, feel free to adjust them to your needs. There's also support for generic menus now.
  * Dynamic timer for quickly creating message/run program/shutdown timers by middle clicking the clock.
  * Much work has been put into making this release feel smoother. For example the FTP upload functions now display progress indicators and don't block the input anymore.
  * Sound volume on screen display.

These are just some of the many changes, for a better overview head to the [http://code.google.com/p/7plus/wiki/Changelog2dot3dot0 Changelog].
