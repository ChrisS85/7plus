= Clipboard plugin =
This plugin is used to access the previously copied Clipboard entries and search through stored clips. Just enter a part of the clip text or its name (if set) to find it.

It's also possible to create new clips this way: Select the text you want to store as clip, open Accessor and select "Store selected text as clip". You will be prompted for a name of the clip then.
