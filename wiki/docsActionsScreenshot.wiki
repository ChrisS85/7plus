= Screenshot =
This action takes a screenshot of the active window or the screen, and saves it to a file.
You may also set the desired image quality.

= Usage examples =
  * In 7plus this is used to take screenshots and directly upload them to an FTP server, so you can easily share them with others.
  * You can also use it locally if you leave out the FTP upload function and save it to a desired folder. You may want to use [docsActionsInput input action] or ${DateTime} [docsGenericPlaceholders placeholder] to give it a unique name.
  * Another possible combination is usage with a [docsTriggersTimer timer trigger], to track what happens on a computer.
