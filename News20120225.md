# 7plus Version 2.5.0 released! #

The last version was unfortunately somewhat buggy, so I decided to release a bugfix release as soon as possible. It should hopefully sort out the issues with the settings window and many other things.

Despite of this there are also a few new features:

  * Search for the selected text with Google by pressing WIN+G.
  * Improved keyboard layout for usage with calculators: Write special characters like brackets on Numpad with disable Numlock.
  * Run temporary AutoHotkey scripts with WIN+T. Requires that AutoHotkey is installed.
  * Added a button that creates a shortcut that triggers an event. Useful for integration of 7plus features on desktop, start menu, etc.
  * F2 while renaming files now toggles between filename, extension and full selection (thanks JSLover for reference implementation and Muramura Suru for suggesting it for 7plus!).
  * Added an action to send emails

For a full list of changes check out the [changelog](http://code.google.com/p/7plus/wiki/Changelog2dot5dot0).
