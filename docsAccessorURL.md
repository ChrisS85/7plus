# URL Accessor Plugin #
The URL plugin makes it possible to Enter URLs in Accessor and it also keeps a history of entered URLs. In its settings you can define how long the list of stored URLs may be and if it should be safed on exit.

This plugin is very useful in combination with [keywords](docsAccessorKeywords.md) as it allows to define keywords for web searches. For example you may type "g 7plus" to launch a google search for 7plus, access wikipedia entries, look for a place/route on google maps and many more.
