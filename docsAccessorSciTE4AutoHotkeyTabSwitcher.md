# SciTE4AutoHotkey Tab Switcher Plugin #
The SciTE4AutoHotkey tab switcher plugin allows to activate SciTE4AutoHotkey and show a specific tab when SciTE4AutoHotkey is running.

This is very useful for users that use SciTE4AutoHotkey for writing code and have many tabs open.

This plugin will remember the string that was previously typed when the current tab was open and restore it when Accessor opens while SciTE4AutoHotkey is active. Additionally to this, the priority of the results of this plugin is increased when SciTE4AutoHotkey was active when Accessor was opened, so they will be shown at the top of the list.

The context menu of this plugin allows to:
  * Open a file with its assigned program
  * Open the path of a file in Explorer/CMD
  * Copy the path of the file to clipboard
  * Show the explorer context menu of the file
