# Description #
7plus is a free open-source program which aspires to make working with Windows as comfortable as possible. The feature set it adds to Windows ranges from interface extensions to the explorer to highly specialized solutions for all common tasks, with the goal of reducing the work load for the user. This feature-rich system, powered by Autohotkey, provides very powerful configuration capabilities to suit the needs you have and those that you have but not know of yet!

Here is a small compilation of use cases where 7plus can greatly enhance your workflow`*`:*** doubleclick on the desktop to create a folder
  * upload any file from the explorer to an FTP server
  * use tabs in Windows Explorer!
  * use hotkeys to launch programs
  * navigate to folders using hotkeys or buttons in the explorer bar!**
[`*`]: Assuming those examples fit your workflow. You can just as well make 7plus do something completely different.

## To everyone who notices that something else doesn't work when 7plus runs: Make sure there is no interference with other programs, such as keyboard or mouse drivers, or other tweaking utitlities! ##

# Features #
As of version 2.0.0, 7plus allows nearly all features to be fully customized. You can change the hotkeys and other parameters defining a feature and you can also **create your own features!**
7plus now uses an event system that is based on triggers, conditions and actions. When a trigger (e.g. a hotkey) is activated, 7plus checks if the associated conditions (such as a specific window being active) are fulfilled, and if they are it runs a series of actions (like sending keys, selecting files, etc..). Nearly all previous features of 7plus are now implemented using this system!

Here are some of the most important features:

  * Store **favorite folders** and recall them for very fast navigation [(Video 1)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTIGxue6WCY) [(Video 2)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC6cnG87j2M)
