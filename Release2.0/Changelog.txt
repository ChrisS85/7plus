7plus Version 2.0.0

New Functions:
+Whole new event-based system in which nearly all features are implemented now. CHECK IT OUT!
+As a result of this, nearly all hotkeys are now customizable.
+This also means that you can create your own functions now!
+Adjust volume with mouse wheel over taskbar.

Program related:
