# MinimizeToTray #
This action can minimize a window in the system tray. This is useful to hide windows you don't want to see all the time, but still need to have them accessible.
Simply use the [WindowFilter controls](docsGenericWindowFilter.md) to select the window.

# Usage examples #
  * In 7plus you can right click on the minimize button of a window to minimize it to the system tray.
  * Alternatively you might want to setup a [hotkey trigger](docsTriggersHotkey.md) to minimize it.
