New Functions:
+ Context menu support on files and folders. This is implemented through a shell extension 
+ Dynamic timer: Start a message/shutdown/run timer by middle clicking the clock 
+ Support for generic menus. It's now possible to design and show (sub)menus and trigger events with the entries. 
+ Window finder tool for easily selecting window titles/classes/executables in event config 
+ Batch Image converter for converting and resizing lots of images at once (through explorer context menu) 
+ MD5 Checksum window for generating MD5 checksums (through explorer context menu) 
+ Progress notification window for FTP upload, and uploading doesn't make the system unresponsive anymore 
+ Volume control OSD for displaying current volume and mute status 
+ "Run with parameters..." context menu option for executable files 
+ "Toggle hidden files" context menu option for directory backgrounds 
+ "Upload" context menu option for files 
+ Added history function for Accessor (CTRL + UP/DOWN Arrow) 
+ Enhanced the input action to support multiple data types (paths, text, numbers, selections,...) 
  and added a condition to ControlEvent action that allows it to react to a selection. 
  Placeholders from this action are now globally accessible in any event. 
+ Added a "Copy Event" feature to the ControlEvent action. This will copy an event temporarily 
  so it can be used in parallel. This is very useful for timers. 
+ Added CTRL+WIN+Tab: Write tab character 
+ Added CTRL+WIN+Enter: Write newline 
+ Added a file switcher for SciTE4AutoHotkey that works exactly like the one for Notepad++. 
  It requires that the latest version of SciTE4AutoHotkey is installed, which is v3 beta 5a at the time of this release.
