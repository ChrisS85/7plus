# 7plus V.1.0 released! #

I'm finally releasing the first version of 7plus.
A lot of time has been spent into bugfixing, so I hope everything works fine now.

7plus supports Windows XP, Windows Vista and of course Windows 7. On other versions, some features might work, but many probably won't, and I don't plan to support any older or non-consumer versions (such as Windows Server) of windows.

I would like to thank everyone who provided useful pieces of code on the forums, helped me on #ahk or supported me in other ways!

Enough babbling, get it here:

I'm happy to hear about comments, reviews and similar, and please let me know if you think that something could be improved or if you have additional ideas that would fit to this program.

Feel free to report bugs by using the [bug tracker](http://code.google.com/p/7plus/issues/list).
