# Event System overview #
Since 2.0.0, 7plus features a new system wich adds lots of customizability and even lets you create own functions! The basic concept is that you define a trigger, which gets activated under certain circumstances, then you may add some additional conditions that decide if the trigger should really be activated, and then you can add a list of actions to be carried out. The system is quite versatile, and there are many useful combinations.

Click the categories below to check out the individual triggers, conditions and actions:
